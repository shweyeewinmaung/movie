2
00:06:59,171 --> 00:07:01,606
Where am I?

3
00:07:56,862 --> 00:07:59,331
Hey, hey. Whoa!

4
00:07:59,364 --> 00:08:01,199
Hey, stop!
Stop right there!

5
00:08:01,233 --> 00:08:02,400
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, hey. Whoa, stop.

6
00:08:02,434 --> 00:08:04,336
Stop, stop, stop.

7
00:08:05,203 --> 00:08:06,471
Stop.

8
00:08:13,178 --> 00:08:15,347
What the hell's
going on out here?

9
00:08:22,487 --> 00:08:23,488
Tex.

10
00:08:24,923 --> 00:08:25,924
Tex!

11
00:08:28,593 --> 00:08:30,195
I'm just eating
some canned chili, Sarge.

12
00:08:30,228 --> 00:08:31,696
You want some?

13
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:33,665
Get your ass out here and tell
me what this woman's saying.

14
00:08:36,001 --> 00:08:37,636
Hey, woman,
what you saying?

15
00:08:41,173 --> 00:08:42,641
She ain't saying
shit, Sarge.

16
00:08:43,241 --> 00:08:45,143
Ask her who she is,

17
00:08:45,177 --> 00:08:47,312
and what's with
that stiff in that cart?

18
00:08:48,213 --> 00:08:49,548
Copy that.

19
00:08:55,954 --> 00:08:57,022
Okay.

20
00:08:57,656 --> 00:08:58,657
Huh?

21
00:09:17,609 --> 00:09:19,177
What'd she say?

22
00:09:19,211 --> 00:09:21,479
Um, I don't
really know, Sarge.

23
00:09:21,513 --> 00:09:22,881
I... I think
she said...

24
00:09:22,914 --> 00:09:25,584
I think she said,
um, they fixed him,

25
00:09:25,617 --> 00:09:27,419
or something like neutered
him, or something.

26
00:09:27,452 --> 00:09:28,954
She stitched
him up.

27
00:09:30,088 --> 00:09:31,890
You're crap
for an interpreter.

28
00:09:33,024 --> 00:09:33,959
Sarge,

29
00:09:33,992 --> 00:09:36,728
this woman has very poor
communication skills.

30
00:09:36,761 --> 00:09:37,596
Figure it out.

31
00:09:37,629 --> 00:09:40,065
Sarge, he's not dead.

32
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,488
What?

33
00:10:06,491 --> 00:10:08,493
What's she saying?

34
00:10:08,526 --> 00:10:10,296
I think she said
he got hit by a comet.

35
00:10:10,329 --> 00:10:11,963
Jesus, Tex.

36
00:10:27,245 --> 00:10:28,381
What?

37
00:10:28,413 --> 00:10:30,515
She said he has
a hole in his temple.

38
00:10:30,548 --> 00:10:31,883
A hole in his temple?

39
00:10:33,618 --> 00:10:37,022
Yup, I'm right about that.
I know that part.

40
00:10:39,358 --> 00:10:40,558
No.

41
00:10:47,999 --> 00:10:49,801
Ah! No.

42
00:10:50,535 --> 00:10:52,103
It's a Buddhist temple.

43
00:10:52,137 --> 00:10:53,438
It has a hole in it.

44
00:10:53,471 --> 00:10:55,840
And then some dead guy
comes through it.

45
00:10:57,242 --> 00:10:58,476
Yeah.

46
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,811
Thought you knew
the goddamn language.

47
00:10:59,844 --> 00:11:01,414
Man, I thought
I did too, man.

48
00:11:01,446 --> 00:11:03,615
That <i>Burmese for Dummies</i>
is just not working out.

49
00:11:03,648 --> 00:11:04,950
Just one
of their myths?

50
00:11:09,254 --> 00:11:10,789
You're making me look
real bad now.

51
00:11:40,386 --> 00:11:41,953
You the plutonium mule?

52
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,528
Where am I?

53
00:11:51,464 --> 00:11:54,065
We talking
nuclear facility?

54
00:11:55,401 --> 00:11:56,935
What?

55
00:11:56,968 --> 00:11:58,404
You'll tell us.
What's your name?

56
00:12:02,974 --> 00:12:04,075
You have a name?

57
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,281
Well...

58
00:12:09,315 --> 00:12:10,882
while you're
working on it,

59
00:12:11,417 --> 00:12:12,617
I'm working on it too.

60
00:12:13,818 --> 00:12:15,553
I'm with
Army Intelligence.

61
00:12:19,157 --> 00:12:20,225
And I'm good.

62
00:12:24,696 --> 00:12:26,598
<i>How did you wind up
with that injury?</i>

63
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,634
Hmm?

64
00:12:29,667 --> 00:12:31,536
<i>Where did
you get the stitch job?</i>

65
00:12:36,308 --> 00:12:37,343
Good talk.

66
00:12:37,376 --> 00:12:38,810
Well, in the meantime,

67
00:12:38,843 --> 00:12:40,545
I'm running you through
facial recognition.

68
00:12:40,578 --> 00:12:42,881
It's an international
database.

69
00:12:44,249 --> 00:12:45,583
Your fingerprints...

70
00:12:46,117 --> 00:12:48,119
we've got those, too.

71
00:12:48,153 --> 00:12:51,656
So we'll find out.
Or you can just tell me.

72
00:12:54,592 --> 00:12:55,960
I can't remember.

73
00:12:57,128 --> 00:12:58,797
Hmm.

74
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:00,299
What are you
doing in Burma?

75
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,567
Burma?

76
00:13:04,702 --> 00:13:06,237
I thought
it was Myanmar.

77
00:13:06,271 --> 00:13:08,307
Very funny.

78
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:16,515
If what you're doing here
has anything to do

79
00:13:16,549 --> 00:13:18,049
with what
I'm doing here...

80
00:13:18,983 --> 00:13:20,585
I've got a problem
with that.

81
00:13:22,288 --> 00:13:24,423
Are you a ronin?
Merc for hire?

82
00:13:24,457 --> 00:13:25,790
Did you sneak in
the yellow cake,

83
00:13:25,824 --> 00:13:27,258
or are you in it deeper?

84
00:13:28,561 --> 00:13:29,894
Cake?

85
00:13:31,497 --> 00:13:32,697
Hmm.

86
00:13:34,999 --> 00:13:36,768
We found this
in your outfit.

87
00:13:39,505 --> 00:13:40,705
That yours?

88
00:13:46,144 --> 00:13:47,413
Yeah. Thanks.

89
00:13:47,446 --> 00:13:49,180
Hmm. You're welcome.

90
00:13:51,683 --> 00:13:52,984
Where's the other stuff?

91
00:13:54,252 --> 00:13:55,321
What stuff?

92
00:13:56,754 --> 00:13:58,089
I'm not sure.

93
00:14:02,428 --> 00:14:03,895
What do you use this for?

94
00:14:04,963 --> 00:14:07,031
Uh, I don't know.
Locate radiation.

95
00:14:17,642 --> 00:14:19,378
This is doable.
I just...

96
00:14:20,245 --> 00:14:21,547
I need more time.

97
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,714
What about that
tattoo he's got?

98
00:14:22,747 --> 00:14:24,015
You ask him
about that?

99
00:14:24,048 --> 00:14:26,251
Not yet. I'm still trying
to get him to talk.

100
00:14:27,386 --> 00:14:28,853
Well, let's
get on it, then.

101
00:14:28,887 --> 00:14:30,755
It's too soon.

102
00:14:30,788 --> 00:14:32,023
He's got a massive
head trauma.

103
00:14:32,056 --> 00:14:34,225
Look,
we can cry about it later.

104
00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:35,394
Can we do this now?

105
00:14:45,103 --> 00:14:46,137
Come on.

106
00:16:31,577 --> 00:16:33,177
It's a truth serum.

107
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:37,316
Who are you working for?

108
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:42,521
They call it the Valley
of the Temples, right?

109
00:16:46,659 --> 00:16:48,694
You know what
I don't understand?

110
00:16:48,727 --> 00:16:50,995
How the hell
are you still alive?

111
00:16:54,132 --> 00:16:55,166
We already know
that there are

112
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,703
excessive levels
of plutonium there.

113
00:16:57,736 --> 00:16:59,037
We know this.

114
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:01,039
We don't think the
Burmese know about it.

115
00:17:01,072 --> 00:17:03,676
And the Chinese,
they'd be too smart

116
00:17:03,709 --> 00:17:06,210
to try to sneak this by,
so they don't know.

117
00:17:07,211 --> 00:17:08,614
But you know.

118
00:17:08,647 --> 00:17:10,014
Who are you
working for?

119
00:17:10,815 --> 00:17:12,850
Who are you working for?

120
00:17:14,353 --> 00:17:15,554
Why are you here?

121
00:17:20,992 --> 00:17:22,461
I'm here to do a job.

122
00:17:22,494 --> 00:17:23,562
Good.

123
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,497
Bingo.

124
00:17:26,765 --> 00:17:30,134
The fisherman's wife
brought me here.

125
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,172
She thought
you'd help me.

126
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,007
With what?

127
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:44,115
All right,
everybody out.

128
00:17:44,148 --> 00:17:45,950
I can take it
from here.

129
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,218
You heard me.
Everybody out.

130
00:17:48,152 --> 00:17:49,321
Move.

131
00:17:49,688 --> 00:17:51,155
Move!

132
00:17:51,189 --> 00:17:52,857
All right,
let's cut the crap,

133
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:54,526
because I already
know your deal.

134
00:17:55,594 --> 00:17:56,628
Just...

135
00:17:59,063 --> 00:18:00,632
they move so fast.

136
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,539
They move so fast.

137
00:18:09,575 --> 00:18:11,008
You don't even
stand a chance.

138
00:18:12,411 --> 00:18:14,513
You don't stand
a chance against what?

139
00:18:23,789 --> 00:18:25,123
What was that about?

140
00:18:30,396 --> 00:18:32,297
I think he's telling
the truth.

141
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,600
He really lost
his memory.

142
00:18:35,634 --> 00:18:37,636
Or he's just
one hell of an operative.

143
00:18:39,103 --> 00:18:41,573
Or we try
a softer approach.

144
00:18:42,775 --> 00:18:44,008
I'll take him out
for some air.

145
00:18:50,214 --> 00:18:51,717
Huh.

146
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,328
Anything coming
back to you?

147
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:05,664
Just a headache.

148
00:19:07,466 --> 00:19:09,635
I was hoping,
with some walking around,

149
00:19:10,736 --> 00:19:12,304
visual stimuli...

150
00:19:13,271 --> 00:19:16,875
Look,
we are classified,

151
00:19:16,909 --> 00:19:18,811
and we needed to know
if you're on our side.

152
00:19:18,844 --> 00:19:20,144
Against who?

153
00:20:01,252 --> 00:20:02,253
Hmm.

154
00:22:32,871 --> 00:22:34,473
Come on! Come on!

155
00:22:36,308 --> 00:22:37,309
Go!

156
00:22:56,193 --> 00:22:57,496
We got to go.

157
00:22:58,296 --> 00:23:00,632
- Let's go!
- We need backup!

158
00:23:06,705 --> 00:23:09,240
Hey. Hey

159
00:23:09,908 --> 00:23:11,275
Where are we going?

160
00:23:36,635 --> 00:23:37,836
Ow!

161
00:25:04,823 --> 00:25:06,725
Come.

162
00:25:36,855 --> 00:25:38,356
Jake!

163
00:25:39,191 --> 00:25:41,560
Don't move, Jake.

164
00:25:41,593 --> 00:25:44,297
Don't even think about
moving without all of us.

165
00:25:44,362 --> 00:25:46,932
Jake, look at me.
Tell me you understand.

166
00:25:46,965 --> 00:25:50,001
You know you're risking everybody's
life by being here, right?

167
00:25:50,035 --> 00:25:51,403
You're supposed to be dead.

168
00:25:51,436 --> 00:25:54,105
We got a plan. We don't
stick to it, everything goes to shit.

169
00:25:54,139 --> 00:25:55,674
What happened to you?

170
00:26:10,989 --> 00:26:12,357
Jake...

171
00:26:15,794 --> 00:26:17,262
Who are you?

172
00:26:17,296 --> 00:26:19,698
Who are we?
What are you doing?

173
00:26:19,731 --> 00:26:21,833
- Who wants to know?
- I do.

174
00:26:21,867 --> 00:26:23,602
And who are you?

175
00:26:23,635 --> 00:26:25,770
Are you really asking me
who I am?

176
00:26:25,804 --> 00:26:26,938
Yeah.

177
00:26:26,972 --> 00:26:27,973
Really?

178
00:26:31,276 --> 00:26:32,577
You don't know them?

179
00:26:40,252 --> 00:26:41,887
Son of a bitch.

180
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:53,164
What happened to you?

181
00:26:53,965 --> 00:26:56,001
Hey. Hey, Jake.

182
00:26:57,269 --> 00:26:58,670
Where'd you go?

183
00:28:15,246 --> 00:28:16,948
Do not move.

184
00:31:54,832 --> 00:31:56,502
<i>Charlie 2-0,</i>
<i>this is Charlie 2-1.</i>

185
00:31:56,535 --> 00:31:57,969
<i>Is anyone there?</i>

186
00:31:59,371 --> 00:32:01,105
<i>Who the hell
were those Jedi Knights</i>

187
00:32:01,139 --> 00:32:02,774
<i>that just took out
my entire unit?</i>

188
00:32:03,609 --> 00:32:05,710
I don't know.
But they knew me.

189
00:32:05,743 --> 00:32:06,778
Called me Jake.

190
00:32:06,811 --> 00:32:08,846
Huh. Well,
there's some progress.

191
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,950
Who are they?
Why are they here?

192
00:32:11,983 --> 00:32:13,718
I'm pretty sure
I belong with them.

193
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,655
What did they want?

194
00:32:16,689 --> 00:32:18,990
It's not important.
You have to leave the area.

195
00:32:19,023 --> 00:32:20,825
You're asking all
the wrong questions.

196
00:32:23,094 --> 00:32:25,564
<i>He said
his name is Jake.</i>

197
00:32:25,598 --> 00:32:27,065
<i>He's still foggy
from the shock,</i>

198
00:32:27,098 --> 00:32:29,767
but he did say that we have
to leave the area.

199
00:32:30,436 --> 00:32:31,403
We? What do you mean, us?

200
00:32:31,437 --> 00:32:33,004
He's just saying
we abort the whole mission?

201
00:32:33,037 --> 00:32:34,973
He's insistent.

202
00:32:36,575 --> 00:32:38,377
What are you not
telling me?

203
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:41,846
Let's just say it's not just
about plutonium levels anymore.

204
00:32:42,548 --> 00:32:44,048
This is just
a cover story?

205
00:32:44,082 --> 00:32:47,185
The story is,
you follow my orders.

206
00:32:47,218 --> 00:32:48,454
What about Jake?

207
00:32:49,688 --> 00:32:50,989
He's coming with us.

208
00:32:51,022 --> 00:32:52,358
What, in that mental state?

209
00:32:52,391 --> 00:32:53,925
I'm not
leaving him here.

210
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,509
Geiger counter's
going crazy.

211
00:34:23,515 --> 00:34:25,317
It's not that kind
of radiation.

212
00:34:28,354 --> 00:34:30,322
Well, what kind
of radiation is it?

213
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,735
You owe me.

214
00:34:42,768 --> 00:34:44,570
Try to make a move,
I shoot you.

215
00:34:44,603 --> 00:34:45,937
Is that clear?

216
00:34:47,872 --> 00:34:49,842
There's something
in there.

217
00:34:49,874 --> 00:34:51,377
They don't know
what they're facing.

218
00:34:51,410 --> 00:34:52,578
Shut up.

219
00:34:52,611 --> 00:34:54,145
They'll get
themselves killed.

220
00:35:00,885 --> 00:35:03,020
- Move.
- Two down.

221
00:35:03,489 --> 00:35:04,857
We need backup.

222
00:35:10,895 --> 00:35:12,096
Come on, hurry!

223
00:35:24,476 --> 00:35:25,577
We're three down!

224
00:35:27,145 --> 00:35:28,946
That's four down!

225
00:35:30,816 --> 00:35:32,384
Chuck, get me out of here!

226
00:35:32,751 --> 00:35:34,853
Aah! No!

227
00:35:34,887 --> 00:35:36,755
No!

228
00:35:36,789 --> 00:35:38,290
What the hell is this?

229
00:35:39,056 --> 00:35:40,158
We call in
an air strike

230
00:35:40,191 --> 00:35:41,326
and tell them
we're being attacked

231
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,994
by some dudes
from outer space.

232
00:35:43,027 --> 00:35:44,329
You want a Section 8?

233
00:35:44,363 --> 00:35:45,531
Yes! Yes!

234
00:35:45,564 --> 00:35:46,698
If that means staying alive.

235
00:35:46,732 --> 00:35:48,232
- No.
- Then call me crazy.

236
00:35:48,266 --> 00:35:49,301
Call it in!

237
00:35:49,334 --> 00:35:50,268
He's after me.

238
00:35:50,302 --> 00:35:52,638
Oh, well, then,
everybody say bye to Jake.

239
00:35:52,671 --> 00:35:53,705
Bye, Jake!

240
00:35:53,739 --> 00:35:55,908
Let's go, come on! Oh!

241
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,709
- Shit.
- We have to get out of here.

242
00:35:57,743 --> 00:35:59,143
You think?

243
00:36:43,689 --> 00:36:44,756
Hmm.

244
00:37:07,546 --> 00:37:09,515
Oh, my God.

245
00:37:15,554 --> 00:37:17,322
Hey.

246
00:37:17,356 --> 00:37:19,391
We have to go back
for Captain Sand.

247
00:37:19,424 --> 00:37:20,425
There's no time.

248
00:37:23,362 --> 00:37:24,363
Hmm.

249
00:37:46,418 --> 00:37:48,320
Did you hear that?

250
00:38:03,535 --> 00:38:04,636
Whoo.

251
00:38:06,638 --> 00:38:09,041
Wow! Man, you did it!

252
00:38:09,073 --> 00:38:10,442
Whoo, you did it, man.

253
00:38:10,475 --> 00:38:13,345
Come on.
Come on, give me some!

254
00:38:13,378 --> 00:38:15,781
Man, you know how famous
you're gonna be, dawg?

255
00:38:15,814 --> 00:38:17,950
You're gonna be so famous right now.
You know how big this is?

256
00:38:17,983 --> 00:38:19,284
This is bigger than Bigfoot.

257
00:38:19,318 --> 00:38:20,319
Move!

258
00:39:08,667 --> 00:39:09,801
Whoa!

259
00:39:15,707 --> 00:39:16,808
Jake!

260
00:40:00,852 --> 00:40:02,253
Who are you?

261
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:06,491
You don't know?

262
00:40:07,559 --> 00:40:08,593
No.

263
00:40:11,262 --> 00:40:12,864
Forgot a few things, huh?

264
00:40:15,367 --> 00:40:16,435
I'm you
in a few years

265
00:40:16,468 --> 00:40:18,269
if you don't get
your shit together.

266
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:19,738
You know me?

267
00:40:19,771 --> 00:40:20,806
I am you.

268
00:40:26,078 --> 00:40:27,179
I don't get it.

269
00:40:27,211 --> 00:40:28,680
No one ever gets
what I mean.

270
00:40:31,248 --> 00:40:34,419
Now, someone in your situation
only has two choices.

271
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,588
Be like me,

272
00:40:37,055 --> 00:40:38,924
or a warrior.

273
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:46,665
That's my
favorite chair.

274
00:40:46,698 --> 00:40:48,333
I knew you'd
find it comfortable.

275
00:40:55,841 --> 00:40:56,975
Ho-ho-ho.

276
00:40:57,976 --> 00:40:59,444
Get off my piano.

277
00:41:06,184 --> 00:41:07,886
But it's
a pretty good life.

278
00:41:07,919 --> 00:41:09,588
I mean, I've got
my hobbies.

279
00:41:09,621 --> 00:41:11,690
I make hats
out of newspapers.

280
00:41:11,723 --> 00:41:12,724
Look at this.

281
00:41:14,426 --> 00:41:16,862
You see the attention
to detail?

282
00:41:16,895 --> 00:41:18,997
It's an art. It's a craft.

283
00:41:23,401 --> 00:41:26,638
But it takes time,
and I got plenty of time.

284
00:41:26,671 --> 00:41:28,607
And if I get
a little hungry,

285
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,042
they usually throw me
some food down at the Valley.

286
00:41:31,843 --> 00:41:33,311
The Valley?

287
00:41:33,345 --> 00:41:34,379
The Valley of the Temples.

288
00:41:34,412 --> 00:41:35,680
You don't even
remember that?

289
00:41:37,816 --> 00:41:39,351
Yeah.

290
00:41:39,384 --> 00:41:40,919
That's where
it all goes down.

291
00:41:47,559 --> 00:41:48,827
You know, I'm going to
have to figure out a way

292
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,128
to smarten you up.

293
00:41:50,162 --> 00:41:51,663
Must have been
a pretty bad fall.

294
00:42:03,909 --> 00:42:05,010
He wanted you here.

295
00:42:05,043 --> 00:42:06,344
Who?

296
00:42:06,378 --> 00:42:08,980
The Poet Warrior
in the sci-fi sense.

297
00:42:09,447 --> 00:42:10,816
The Space Man.

298
00:42:21,326 --> 00:42:24,362
He's the one that
gave us Jiu Jitsu.

299
00:42:25,864 --> 00:42:27,065
Jiu Jitsu?

300
00:42:27,098 --> 00:42:30,035
You are, right this minute,

301
00:42:30,068 --> 00:42:32,771
exactly where
he wants you to be,

302
00:42:33,205 --> 00:42:34,573
and it is over.

303
00:42:35,106 --> 00:42:36,408
Ball in mitt.

304
00:42:36,441 --> 00:42:38,076
Game, match, set.

305
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:40,045
Checkmate.

306
00:42:41,314 --> 00:42:42,514
Whoo!

307
00:42:48,353 --> 00:42:49,788
See, I can fly too.

308
00:43:10,475 --> 00:43:12,777
Now you're going to face
Brax off right this time.

309
00:43:13,312 --> 00:43:14,813
Brax?

310
00:43:14,846 --> 00:43:16,147
He respects that.

311
00:43:16,815 --> 00:43:17,883
He plays fair.

312
00:43:22,821 --> 00:43:25,257
But if you put
some bullshit soldiers

313
00:43:25,291 --> 00:43:26,825
on the field
with him again,

314
00:43:27,626 --> 00:43:29,594
he'll kill you
in the worst way.

315
00:43:44,876 --> 00:43:45,977
Nice.

316
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,421
Jake?

317
00:43:57,856 --> 00:44:00,191
We're talking.
Can't you see we're talking?

318
00:44:02,694 --> 00:44:04,796
You're gonna want
to come with us, Jake.

319
00:44:04,829 --> 00:44:07,432
No. His mind's
all messed up.

320
00:44:07,465 --> 00:44:08,867
He's crazy,

321
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,035
like me.

322
00:44:13,505 --> 00:44:15,473
We don't have
a lot of time, Jake.

323
00:44:15,507 --> 00:44:17,542
You know what
this is, right?

324
00:44:18,411 --> 00:44:19,611
You know us.

325
00:44:20,545 --> 00:44:21,913
I don't think he does.

326
00:44:23,448 --> 00:44:25,617
Jake, you come with us.

327
00:44:26,184 --> 00:44:27,719
Come with us.
Come on.

328
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,522
Come on, you can
trust me. Come on.

329
00:45:08,626 --> 00:45:10,061
Let them know
we found him.

330
00:45:11,496 --> 00:45:13,064
Rendezvous at
the temple.

331
00:45:48,533 --> 00:45:51,102
Hey, maybe I could
get something to eat.

332
00:45:51,803 --> 00:45:55,374
Like a noodle
or a pickle.

333
00:45:55,408 --> 00:45:56,975
Somebody give
Wylie some food.

334
00:46:26,004 --> 00:46:27,072
Jake...

335
00:46:29,274 --> 00:46:30,642
he comes from there.

336
00:46:31,843 --> 00:46:35,013
It's the comet you see
in the sky right now.

337
00:46:35,046 --> 00:46:38,817
It passes over the earth
every six years,

338
00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:41,152
and causes a portal
right here.

339
00:46:42,053 --> 00:46:43,088
But when it's open,

340
00:46:43,121 --> 00:46:45,723
we get a visitor
from a distant galaxy.

341
00:46:45,757 --> 00:46:47,258
I mean, he actually
comes here from a place

342
00:46:47,293 --> 00:46:51,596
millions of light years away
looking for a fight with you,

343
00:46:51,629 --> 00:46:52,831
the chosen Jiu Jitsu.

344
00:46:54,766 --> 00:46:56,435
And if he
doesn't get it,

345
00:46:56,469 --> 00:46:59,237
he stays
and he kills everything.

346
00:46:59,270 --> 00:47:02,674
He taught our ancestors
how to fight him.

347
00:47:03,476 --> 00:47:04,943
Then you took an oath...

348
00:47:06,312 --> 00:47:07,879
and that's how he did it.

349
00:47:09,614 --> 00:47:12,050
That's how he gave you
Jiu Jitsu.

350
00:47:20,326 --> 00:47:22,093
Yeah, I could eat.

351
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:24,189
Jake...

352
00:48:26,292 --> 00:48:27,359
Hey.

353
00:48:27,825 --> 00:48:29,093
Pay attention.

354
00:48:29,127 --> 00:48:30,529
Keep your
head on straight.

355
00:48:30,563 --> 00:48:31,963
I said, suit him up.

356
00:48:34,032 --> 00:48:35,033
Hmm.

357
00:48:40,772 --> 00:48:43,174
If you cover yourself
completely with this,

358
00:48:44,310 --> 00:48:45,311
Brax can't see you.

359
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,214
Look at me.
Look at me.

360
00:48:50,782 --> 00:48:52,116
I don't know
how much you forgot,

361
00:48:52,850 --> 00:48:54,185
but it better not be this.

362
00:49:08,032 --> 00:49:09,033
Look up.

363
00:49:09,834 --> 00:49:11,470
You see it?
Twelve o'clock.

364
00:49:17,175 --> 00:49:19,478
By the time it gets to those
trees, it'll be dark.

365
00:49:20,878 --> 00:49:23,616
Fighting Brax in the
dark is not what we want.

366
00:49:23,649 --> 00:49:25,451
We want to bring the
fight to him before then.

367
00:49:27,852 --> 00:49:29,355
Thanks to you, we got to
climb up this hill

368
00:49:29,388 --> 00:49:30,989
with the Geiger counters.

369
00:49:31,022 --> 00:49:32,691
We got to find him,
we got to lure him out,

370
00:49:32,725 --> 00:49:33,925
get the edge.

371
00:49:35,661 --> 00:49:37,929
What happens after dark?

372
00:49:37,962 --> 00:49:40,299
If Brax doesn't square off
and kill us by then,

373
00:49:40,332 --> 00:49:42,334
the hole doesn't close
and he stays.

374
00:49:43,569 --> 00:49:44,836
Everyone dies.

375
00:49:45,304 --> 00:49:46,305
Everyone.

376
00:49:49,907 --> 00:49:52,311
You used to say the fight
was worth dying for, Jake.

377
00:49:53,845 --> 00:49:55,046
All the time.

378
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:57,181
I believed you.

379
00:49:59,485 --> 00:50:00,486
Try to keep up.

380
00:50:04,822 --> 00:50:06,558
A lot of us thought it would
be you who has the chance

381
00:50:06,592 --> 00:50:07,992
to take Brax out.

382
00:50:09,093 --> 00:50:11,262
You look puzzled.
Are you puzzled?

383
00:50:11,297 --> 00:50:13,898
I mean, I get it. I'm puzzled.
I'm real puzzled.

384
00:50:13,931 --> 00:50:16,769
There's a comet, there's a
portal, there's Brax.

385
00:50:16,801 --> 00:50:18,036
Why don't I remember
any of this?

386
00:50:18,069 --> 00:50:20,104
Don't worry so much about
what you don't remember.

387
00:50:20,138 --> 00:50:21,172
Which is
pretty much everything.

388
00:50:21,205 --> 00:50:22,608
The main thing
is to focus.

389
00:50:22,641 --> 00:50:24,710
- You remember how to do that?
- Maybe.

390
00:50:24,743 --> 00:50:26,512
Maybe?
You've been preparing

391
00:50:26,545 --> 00:50:27,912
for this fight
your entire life.

392
00:50:27,945 --> 00:50:29,947
That makes sense.
Fighting that son of a bitch

393
00:50:29,981 --> 00:50:31,115
makes all the sense
in the world.

394
00:50:31,149 --> 00:50:32,484
Yeah, you got
to fight him.

395
00:50:32,518 --> 00:50:33,885
Even if it kills you,
you got to fight him.

396
00:50:33,918 --> 00:50:35,487
You get your honor back.

397
00:50:35,521 --> 00:50:37,356
Now, Brax fights
nine fighters.

398
00:50:37,389 --> 00:50:39,625
Fight, fight, fight, fight,
fight, fight, fight, fight, fight,

399
00:50:39,658 --> 00:50:40,958
and then he goes home.

400
00:50:40,992 --> 00:50:43,127
But if any of the fighters
refuse to fight him,

401
00:50:43,629 --> 00:50:44,896
he devours.

402
00:50:44,929 --> 00:50:47,932
He devours anything that
walks, flies, crawls.

403
00:50:47,965 --> 00:50:51,069
I mean, he destroys
entire towns and villages.

404
00:50:51,102 --> 00:50:53,806
Now, you...
you, you, you, you, you.

405
00:50:53,838 --> 00:50:56,608
You maybe might actually
have to die.

406
00:50:56,642 --> 00:50:59,043
But as long
as you die bravely,

407
00:50:59,077 --> 00:51:00,646
no one else will have to.

408
00:51:00,679 --> 00:51:01,846
Not for another six years.

409
00:51:01,879 --> 00:51:05,917
That is alien politics
five through fifteen.

410
00:51:06,585 --> 00:51:07,919
You said
he fights nine.

411
00:51:07,952 --> 00:51:09,355
Why is there
only eight of us?

412
00:51:10,289 --> 00:51:11,824
Like I said,
don't worry so much

413
00:51:11,856 --> 00:51:13,024
about what you
don't remember.

414
00:51:13,057 --> 00:51:14,892
- I want to know.
- Keep moving.

415
00:51:15,728 --> 00:51:17,995
- We lost a guy.
- What happened?

416
00:51:18,731 --> 00:51:19,931
Brax happened.

417
00:51:20,733 --> 00:51:22,133
Brax.

418
00:51:22,166 --> 00:51:24,001
Brax. You know
who that is, right?

419
00:51:26,971 --> 00:51:29,073
Breathe. You got this.

420
00:51:29,808 --> 00:51:31,075
You got this.

421
00:51:39,518 --> 00:51:40,652
What are you doing?

422
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:43,154
Hey.

423
00:51:43,187 --> 00:51:44,490
I said,
stay together.

424
00:51:45,056 --> 00:51:46,090
Don't lag behind.

425
00:51:46,124 --> 00:51:47,493
You want to keep up
with this crowd,

426
00:51:47,526 --> 00:51:48,594
you don't slack.

427
00:51:53,231 --> 00:51:55,032
You don't think we should
go look for him?

428
00:51:57,503 --> 00:51:59,638
This was your plan, Jake.

429
00:51:59,671 --> 00:52:00,672
Your plan.

430
00:52:02,608 --> 00:52:03,642
I had a plan?

431
00:52:03,675 --> 00:52:05,310
Don't tell me.

432
00:52:06,144 --> 00:52:07,579
You forgot the plan?

433
00:52:08,313 --> 00:52:10,081
It was
your plan, Jake.

434
00:52:10,114 --> 00:52:11,350
He'll get it.

435
00:52:11,383 --> 00:52:13,017
Are you trying
to confuse him?

436
00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:15,086
Hey, it's okay.
It's okay.

437
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:17,021
Remember what I said.
You're the rabbit.

438
00:52:17,054 --> 00:52:20,459
You just follow me, okay?
Keep moving.

439
00:52:20,492 --> 00:52:22,561
Don't get distracted.
This is all just noise.

440
00:52:22,594 --> 00:52:24,630
Just rise above it.
Come on.

441
00:52:28,434 --> 00:52:29,601
Split up here.

442
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:35,707
Victor, Franz, Forbes, Jake,
you take that road.

443
00:52:35,741 --> 00:52:37,108
We'll meet you up
on the hill.

444
00:52:39,243 --> 00:52:40,978
Wylie, it's time
for you to fall back.

445
00:52:41,979 --> 00:52:43,282
You see Brax,
you send up a flare.

446
00:52:43,315 --> 00:52:45,350
He'll be after Jake,
you put him on point.

447
00:52:46,083 --> 00:52:47,286
We'll meet you up there.

448
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:49,488
We good?

449
00:52:49,521 --> 00:52:51,088
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

450
00:52:51,590 --> 00:52:52,591
Let's go.

451
00:52:57,128 --> 00:52:58,497
Was that necessary?

452
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:00,566
You know it was.

453
00:53:45,577 --> 00:53:47,646
Jake, I'm sorry, man.

454
00:53:49,548 --> 00:53:50,582
It's not your fault.

455
00:53:51,783 --> 00:53:52,784
Don't worry about it.

456
00:54:06,465 --> 00:54:07,699
Keep moving.

457
00:54:07,733 --> 00:54:08,867
What are you
talking about?

458
00:54:08,901 --> 00:54:10,101
Just keep moving.

459
00:54:10,536 --> 00:54:11,537
No.

460
00:54:12,136 --> 00:54:13,372
No, we're not leaving you.

461
00:54:15,072 --> 00:54:16,775
Jake, you're the rabbit.

462
00:54:17,676 --> 00:54:18,677
I got this.

463
00:54:25,884 --> 00:54:27,084
Go.

464
00:54:34,793 --> 00:54:35,794
It's my time.

465
01:01:13,024 --> 01:01:14,025
Hey.

466
01:01:14,993 --> 01:01:16,027
Wake up.

467
01:01:22,267 --> 01:01:23,902
I got a license to kill you.

468
01:01:24,636 --> 01:01:26,204
No expiration date.

469
01:01:27,839 --> 01:01:29,941
So you're gonna tell me
everything you know.

470
01:01:34,946 --> 01:01:36,848
And I'll tell you
everything I know.

471
01:01:52,764 --> 01:01:53,932
Okay.

472
01:01:56,267 --> 01:01:58,570
Nobody knows
the mission but me.

473
01:02:00,038 --> 01:02:02,574
I've been clocking that thing
for 24 years

474
01:02:02,607 --> 01:02:04,175
for Army Intelligence.

475
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:08,847
What's your procedure?

476
01:02:09,647 --> 01:02:11,716
Your crew goes in
one by one?

477
01:02:12,584 --> 01:02:14,152
That's pretty much
how it is, yeah.

478
01:02:15,488 --> 01:02:16,888
That's not good enough.

479
01:02:18,290 --> 01:02:19,924
I lost too many good men...

480
01:02:21,126 --> 01:02:22,127
and women...

481
01:02:23,396 --> 01:02:24,963
following orders.

482
01:02:29,267 --> 01:02:30,835
You can do it different.

483
01:02:31,836 --> 01:02:34,039
He can heal
from almost anything.

484
01:02:35,006 --> 01:02:37,075
But it takes him
about five or six seconds

485
01:02:37,108 --> 01:02:38,543
before he's whole again.

486
01:02:39,744 --> 01:02:41,546
That's your window.

487
01:02:41,579 --> 01:02:43,315
That's enough time
for you.

488
01:02:54,726 --> 01:02:56,094
Get to it, soldier.

489
01:03:41,106 --> 01:03:43,675
Do you ever ask
yourself the question,

490
01:03:44,410 --> 01:03:47,245
"Why am I still alive?"

491
01:03:47,278 --> 01:03:48,847
So you think
this is funny?

492
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:51,082
He's playing with his
food, don't you think?

493
01:03:52,183 --> 01:03:53,685
He's like a killer whale

494
01:03:53,718 --> 01:03:57,122
in the frozen waters
of the Arctic with a seal.

495
01:03:57,155 --> 01:03:59,558
He fools with its head
and then he kills it.

496
01:03:59,592 --> 01:04:01,759
It's horrible.
Pull up a chair.

497
01:04:03,962 --> 01:04:04,963
Okay.

498
01:04:05,464 --> 01:04:06,664
You know something?

499
01:04:07,566 --> 01:04:10,135
I know something
you don't know.

500
01:04:10,168 --> 01:04:14,672
I know that the Space Man
actually likes you.

501
01:04:15,574 --> 01:04:16,641
He likes you

502
01:04:16,674 --> 01:04:19,612
because he's paying you
a very high honor.

503
01:04:19,644 --> 01:04:21,813
And I hate to think
that's undeserved.

504
01:04:22,281 --> 01:04:23,915
A high honor?

505
01:04:23,948 --> 01:04:26,050
Oh, yeah. He's saving
the best for last

506
01:04:26,084 --> 01:04:27,486
out of respect
for your skills.

507
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:29,187
It's an enormous honor.

508
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:32,891
And he bestows it upon you
in spite of what you did.

509
01:04:34,393 --> 01:04:35,394
What did I do?

510
01:04:37,630 --> 01:04:40,265
I was there.
I saw it firsthand.

511
01:07:47,820 --> 01:07:49,621
What you're saying
is that I'm a coward.

512
01:07:49,655 --> 01:07:51,357
Everyone's saying it.

513
01:07:51,390 --> 01:07:52,624
Just not to my face.

514
01:07:54,393 --> 01:07:57,563
The story will be told
for generations.

515
01:07:57,596 --> 01:08:00,432
Just like with me,
six years ago.

516
01:08:00,466 --> 01:08:03,868
I flinched when I faced
him, just like you.

517
01:08:05,069 --> 01:08:07,105
Yeah, I begged for my life,

518
01:08:07,138 --> 01:08:08,940
but he thinks I'm crazy.

519
01:08:08,973 --> 01:08:11,042
There's no honor
in killing crazy.

520
01:08:12,611 --> 01:08:13,878
You actually ran.

521
01:08:13,911 --> 01:08:16,448
And by running,
you allowed him to come here

522
01:08:16,482 --> 01:08:17,915
and kill the innocent.

523
01:08:18,350 --> 01:08:19,451
That's on you.

524
01:08:21,453 --> 01:08:22,454
But this time,

525
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:24,222
we have a plan.

526
01:08:26,090 --> 01:08:27,091
We?

527
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:29,361
So you're one of us?

528
01:08:34,633 --> 01:08:36,067
So tell me this,
old man.

529
01:08:38,035 --> 01:08:39,371
Will I end up
like you?

530
01:08:43,742 --> 01:08:45,943
No, you won't live
long enough.

531
01:08:45,977 --> 01:08:47,379
You won't make it
through the day.

532
01:08:48,946 --> 01:08:50,749
Hmm. Or he won't.

533
01:08:50,783 --> 01:08:53,385
That's more like it.
That's the spirit.

534
01:08:54,152 --> 01:08:55,888
Brax has no use
for a coward.

535
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:57,656
He likes
brave fighters.

536
01:08:57,689 --> 01:08:58,891
Once he has you pegged
as a coward,

537
01:08:58,923 --> 01:09:01,293
you become like
a sporting hunt to him.

538
01:09:01,326 --> 01:09:03,762
He's like Manolete,
the clownish bullfighter,

539
01:09:03,796 --> 01:09:05,330
and you're the bull.

540
01:09:05,364 --> 01:09:06,865
He'll want to make
an example out of you,

541
01:09:06,899 --> 01:09:08,634
prove a point,
mess with your head first,

542
01:09:08,667 --> 01:09:10,001
and then he'll kill you.

543
01:09:19,977 --> 01:09:21,547
See?
It's already started.

544
01:09:22,213 --> 01:09:23,916
He's trying to vex you.

545
01:09:23,948 --> 01:09:25,350
He can stop trying.

546
01:09:39,765 --> 01:09:41,433
You okay?

547
01:09:43,201 --> 01:09:46,037
You know, there is one other
way I failed to mention.

548
01:09:46,805 --> 01:09:47,840
Be a way for you
to make up

549
01:09:47,873 --> 01:09:49,341
for everything
that went before.

550
01:09:51,108 --> 01:09:52,744
You could kill
the son of a bitch.

551
01:09:58,383 --> 01:09:59,217
You're alive.

552
01:09:59,250 --> 01:10:00,586
Son of a bitch.

553
01:10:04,556 --> 01:10:06,325
I'm okay.

554
01:10:06,991 --> 01:10:08,293
You're not okay.

555
01:10:08,327 --> 01:10:09,361
We should get him
under the brush.

556
01:10:09,394 --> 01:10:10,596
He may still
think he's dead.

557
01:10:11,830 --> 01:10:13,732
What about you?
Where'd you come from?

558
01:10:13,765 --> 01:10:14,999
He put me here.

559
01:10:16,267 --> 01:10:17,469
Forbes?

560
01:10:17,503 --> 01:10:18,504
Dead.

561
01:10:19,771 --> 01:10:20,772
Shit.

562
01:10:23,775 --> 01:10:25,176
Comet's moving.

563
01:10:25,209 --> 01:10:26,612
We got to get
this done now.

564
01:10:27,044 --> 01:10:28,246
We move.

565
01:10:29,882 --> 01:10:31,316
Whatever happens...

566
01:10:31,950 --> 01:10:33,217
You got
something to say?

567
01:10:34,419 --> 01:10:35,487
...just remember
the one thing

568
01:10:35,521 --> 01:10:37,756
you always have
with Jiu Jitsu...

569
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:43,227
Leverage.

570
01:10:46,565 --> 01:10:47,633
Move.

571
01:12:01,406 --> 01:12:02,441
Aah!

572
01:12:58,630 --> 01:12:59,765
Aah!

573
01:14:04,663 --> 01:14:06,298
Aah!

574
01:24:08,266 --> 01:24:10,134
He saved our lives.

575
01:24:11,804 --> 01:24:15,507
I always knew he was faking
like he was crazy,

576
01:24:15,541 --> 01:24:17,309
so he could help you.

577
01:24:18,477 --> 01:24:20,346
What are you
talking about?

578
01:24:21,846 --> 01:24:23,382
You really don't know?

579
01:24:27,919 --> 01:24:29,588
He was your father.

580
01:24:58,149 --> 01:24:59,984
He didn't
want me to know.

581
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:03,955
Hey, you're hurt.

582
01:25:03,988 --> 01:25:05,691
Can you breathe?

583
01:25:05,724 --> 01:25:08,126
Almost.
Let's go.

584
01:25:08,159 --> 01:25:10,629
No, no, no, slow down.
Slow down, you have a big wound.

585
01:25:10,662 --> 01:25:11,896
Come here.

586
01:25:32,950 --> 01:25:34,319
Oh, come on.

587
01:25:34,353 --> 01:25:36,187
Don't tell me you two
are about to get on

588
01:25:36,220 --> 01:25:39,056
in this tight-ass temple,
that's real unholy.

589
01:25:39,090 --> 01:25:41,627
Not to mention we got a
goddamn Martian on the loose.

590
01:25:41,660 --> 01:25:42,927
She's hurt.

591
01:25:43,862 --> 01:25:45,864
Oh, she's hurt.
My guys are all dead.

592
01:25:45,898 --> 01:25:48,801
I've been driving around trying
to get a head count, I got <i>nada.</i>

593
01:25:48,834 --> 01:25:50,869
I figured these two
might be of some use.

594
01:25:50,903 --> 01:25:53,204
Not to mention
these bad boys right here.

595
01:25:58,075 --> 01:25:59,944
She going to need a good stitch
job, or what?

596
01:25:59,977 --> 01:26:03,282
Yeah, let's get her
to a safe place.

597
01:26:03,315 --> 01:26:05,417
There's no safe place
around here.

598
01:26:08,085 --> 01:26:11,657
Hey, so you guys are like
some ninja alien killers, huh?

599
01:26:11,690 --> 01:26:12,925
Jiu Jitsu.

600
01:26:12,957 --> 01:26:15,561
Ah, that's why you wear
those funky-ass outfits.

601
01:26:15,594 --> 01:26:17,796
Well, come on, tell me.
You guys are part of some, like,

602
01:26:17,830 --> 01:26:19,932
secret agency
government probe, right?

603
01:26:19,964 --> 01:26:21,467
To take down
Martians and shit?

604
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:23,167
I've been reading
about that stuff, man.

605
01:26:23,201 --> 01:26:25,102
Ever since I started
translating in the Army, man,

606
01:26:25,136 --> 01:26:26,705
I'm finding all kind
of crazy stuff.

607
01:27:02,106 --> 01:27:03,675
What is it?

608
01:27:09,146 --> 01:27:11,316
He said something
about it kills the pain.

609
01:27:12,951 --> 01:27:14,185
I don't need it.

610
01:27:25,931 --> 01:27:27,265
What?

611
01:27:27,299 --> 01:27:29,301
This has been very traumatic for
me, okay?

612
01:27:29,334 --> 01:27:31,336
I still have nightmares from
when I try to milk our pet bull.

613
01:27:31,370 --> 01:27:33,271
You think I won't need
therapy from this shit?

614
01:27:45,884 --> 01:27:48,420
How do you blow such
big holes in him with those arrows?

615
01:27:49,220 --> 01:27:51,122
Blasting caps on the tips.

616
01:27:57,529 --> 01:27:58,764
Here's a thought.

617
01:28:01,198 --> 01:28:02,668
Get me wrapped.

618
01:28:07,238 --> 01:28:08,507
What'd she say?

619
01:28:09,273 --> 01:28:11,275
She says she's ready to go.

620
01:28:20,986 --> 01:28:22,354
What?

621
01:28:22,387 --> 01:28:25,324
I think she said she needs
to stretch, run and exercise.

622
01:28:25,357 --> 01:28:26,391
Yup.

623
01:28:29,361 --> 01:28:30,395
What?

624
01:29:04,863 --> 01:29:05,864
Go.

625
01:30:28,613 --> 01:30:29,614
Aah!

626
01:32:31,336 --> 01:32:33,939
<i>He was your father.</i>

627
01:33:06,104 --> 01:33:07,439
Come on.

628
01:34:17,842 --> 01:34:19,678
<i>But it takes him
about five or six seconds</i>

629
01:34:19,711 --> 01:34:21,479
<i>before he's whole again.</i>

630
01:34:21,513 --> 01:34:23,581
<i>That's your window.</i>

631
01:34:48,374 --> 01:34:49,841
Jake!

632
01:35:02,288 --> 01:35:03,688
Jake!

633
01:36:44,189 --> 01:36:45,256
Mm.

634
01:36:59,371 --> 01:37:00,805
Are we good?

635
01:37:02,073 --> 01:37:03,875
Everything cool?

636
01:37:03,908 --> 01:37:06,077
It's not another one,
is it?

637
01:37:06,111 --> 01:37:08,079
You got to be safe
about these things.

638
01:37:08,113 --> 01:37:09,714
You never know.

639
01:37:09,747 --> 01:37:11,683
It'll be like Goldilocks
and the three aliens out here,

640
01:37:11,716 --> 01:37:12,784
you know what I mean?

641
01:37:12,817 --> 01:37:14,587
Mama alien, baby alien.

642
01:37:14,619 --> 01:37:16,489
Whoo!

643
01:37:16,522 --> 01:37:18,089
Who wants a drink?

644
01:37:18,457 --> 01:37:19,691
Ooh!

645
01:37:33,771 --> 01:37:35,173
Coming right up.

646
01:37:44,916 --> 01:37:46,784
See you in six years.

647
01:38:04,991 --> 01:38:09,991
